    <string name="about">Meerut Institute of Engineering and Technology, affiliated to AKTU (formerly known as UPTU) has been a pioneer educational institute for over 20 years.
It holds pride in being the institute having educated students who have achieved excellence in the fields of academics and organisation.
We believe our sincerity, dedication and focus towards our goal have been instrumental in our accomplishments.\n\nGLITZ, the official literary fest of MIET is a brand in itself. It has grown into Meerutâ€™s most anticipated moment and one of the largest fest in U.P.
What sets GLITZ apart from the other fests is the devotion of the students working for it and the intense desire to deliver the maximum.
The support of the college management plays a crucial role in making the fest, the success we know it every year. It instigates the feeling of happiness and charisma, which is sufficient to satiate the year long wait for this grand fest.
Starting with the exhilarating Heatz followed by the scintillating performances in the radiance of Karaoke night, mesmerized with the stimulating execution in the Curtainâ€™s Call and lot more to grasp jumbled with fun and entertainment is just a fraction of GLITZ.
The competitions in GLITZ have gained a lot of atiraction due to the exciting cash prizes and the platiorm it provides to the youngsters.
The winners get highly motivated which propels them to excel in their fields. Being a youth extravaganza, GLITZ targets the enrichment of the minds of the youth by providing them with countless opportunities to deliver deeper inside oneself and to unlock their deep seated potentials.
\nLooking forward to your association with GLITZ\n\n
